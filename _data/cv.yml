    - title: Research Intern
      institution: TRAIS Lab, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
      year: 2024
      description:
        - Established a new link between data attribution and multi-task learning (MTL), demonstrating how data attribution can efficiently measure task relatedness, a key concept in MTL. 
        - Introduced a scalable data attribution method called MTIF, which addresses the unique challenges of applying data attribution in MTL and provides a fine-grained analysis of data influence.
        - Demonstrated the effectiveness and practical usefulness of the proposed method through extensive experiments.
    - title: Independent Researcher
      institution: TRAIS Lab, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
      year: 2023-2024
      description:
        - Formalized the unlearning sample inference game and established a novel unlearning evaluation metric for data removal efficacy.
        - Demonstrated several provable properties of the proposed metric, circumventing various pitfalls of existing MIA-based metrics.
        - Introduced a straightforward and effective way for efficient empirical analysis. Through thorough theoretical examination and empirical experiments, we show that it exhibits similar desirable properties.

    - title: Research Intern
      institution: Foreseer Lab, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
      year: 2023
      description:
        - Developed a contributor-friendly platform to improve curation of graph learning benchmarks, which optimizes for easy dataset maintenance, dataset usability and better contributor attributions. 
        - Maintained a plethora of massive datasets, including Open Graph Benchmark, MNIST, and CIFAR, which are large scale with millions of nodes and millions to billions of edges. 
        - Contributed to a research paper, which was accepted for oral presentation at the inaugural Learning on Graphs conference, showcasing the impact of the team's work on advancing the field of graph learning. Paper available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04537
