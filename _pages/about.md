<p> Hi! I'm currently a MSCS student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I received a bachelor degree of computer science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a bachelor degree of electrical computer engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During my undergrad, I'm lucky enough to be advised by professor <a href = 'https://umich-foreseer.github.io'> Qiaozhu Mei </a> and <a href='https://jiaqima.github.io'> Jiaqi Ma </a>. </p>

<p>Overall, I aims to find reliable and robust solutions for data-centric machine learning. My current research interests broadly revolve around:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Trustworthy machine learning</em>, in the context of <em> data privacy</em>, <em> machine unlearning</em>, <em> differential privacy </em></li>
  <li><em>Interpretable machine learning</em>, in the context of <em> data attribution </em>, <em> influence functions</em> </li>
</ul>

<p style="color: red;">I am actively looking for research or industry opportunities in machine learning. Please email me if you have relevant opportunities!</p>
