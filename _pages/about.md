Hi! I'm currently an incoming MSCS student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I received a bachelor degree of computer science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a bachelor degree of electrical computer engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I'm broadly interested in trustworthy machine learning, machine unlearning and cryptography. During my undergrad, I'm lucky enough to be advised by professor Qiaozhu Mei and Jiaqi Ma.
