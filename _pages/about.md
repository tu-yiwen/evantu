Hi! I'm currently a MSCS student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I received a bachelor degree of computer science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a bachelor degree of electrical computer engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I'm broadly interested in trustworthy machine learning and interpretable machine learning, especially the topics of machine unlearning and data attribution. During my undergrad, I'm lucky enough to be advised by professor <a href = 'https://umich-foreseer.github.io'> Qiaozhu Mei </a> and <a href='https://jiaqima.github.io'> Jiaqi Ma </a>.
