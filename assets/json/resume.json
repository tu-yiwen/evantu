As machine learning is being applied to broader domains and tasks, there is a need to establish richer and more diverse benchmarks to better reflect the reality of the application scenarios. Graph learning is an emerging field of machine learning that urgently needs more and better benchmarks. To accommodate the need, we introduce Graph Learning Indexer (GLI), a benchmark curation platform for graph learning. In comparison to existing graph learning benchmark libraries, GLI highlights two novel design objectives. First, GLI is designed to incentivize dataset contributors. In particular, we incorporate various measures to minimize the effort of contributing and maintaining a dataset, increase the usability of the contributed dataset, as well as encourage attributions to different contributors of the dataset. Second, GLI is designed to curate a knowledge base, instead of a plain collection, of benchmark datasets."}],"skills":[{"name":"Computer Science","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Machine learning","Artificial intelligence","Deep learning","Graph learning","Machine unlearning","Cryptography"]}],"languages":[{"language":"Chinese","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Computer Science","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Machine learning","Artificial intelligence","Deep learning","Graph learning","Machine unlearning","Cryptography"]}],"references":[],"projects":[]}
